According to me, Development Club is about thinking about cool stuff, innovating ideas , thinking how we can use technology to easy our lives and then converting them into realistic projects. This all is done working in a team of like minded people who would be putting their inputs forward to make the project even more fun to work on. Thinking about it is an amazing feeling!
